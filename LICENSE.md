## Additional Explanation

The GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL) is a free, copyleft license particularly suited for software that runs over a network, such as this Applicant Tracking System. The AGPL is designed to ensure that the source code for the application is made available to its users.

The key feature of the AGPL is that if you modify the software and run it to interact with users over a network, your code modifications must be made available to those users under the AGPL. This ensures that all improvements to the software remain free and open source.
